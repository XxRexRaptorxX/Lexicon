# The first steps

The first thing you need to do, when you spawn into a new world is to search for a *Tree* and punching it until *Logs* drops. 

- Gather a bunch of Logs then open your inventory to turn the *Logs* into *Planks*. 

- Then use 4 *Planks* in your mini crafting grid to create a [*Crafting Table*](../useables/crafting_table.md).

- Now craft with *Planks* some *Sticks* and with both of them a *Wooden Pickaxe*.

- Then find some *Stone* (on mountains or below the dirt), mine them with your *Pickaxe* and craft all standard *Tools* from it.

- The next step is searching *Food*, for quick food kill some *Animals* with your *Sword* and cook the flesh in an [*Furnace*](../useables/furnace.md). 

You can use *Wood* or *Coal* as fuel. 

- And if you have found [*Cows*](../creatures/animal-cow.md), you should craft *Armor* out of the *Leather*.
