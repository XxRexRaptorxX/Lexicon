# Conduit

<ItemImage id="minecraft:conduit" />

A *Conduit* is a beacon-like block that provides [*Conduit Power*](../brewing/effects.md#conduit_power) and attacks hostile mobs underwater. 

The [*Conduit Power*](../brewing/effects.md#conduit_power) effect restores oxygen, gives underwater night vision and increases mining speed.

##  



<Recipe id="minecraft:conduit" />

To activate, a *Conduit* needs to be in the center of a 3×3×3 volume of *Water*, which itself must be enclosed within an activation frame. 

Only *Prismarine*, *Dark Prismarine*, *Prismarine Bricks*, and *Sea Lantern* blocks in the frame contribute to activation. 
These blocks can be found in [*Ocean Monuments*](../world/structures.md#monument).
