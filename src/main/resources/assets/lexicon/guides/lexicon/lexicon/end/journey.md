# The journey to the End

## Step 1: Obtaining resources

The first important thing on your way to the [*End*](../world/dimensions.md#end) are <ItemLink id="minecraft:ender_eye" />. 

You can craft them with a <ItemLink id="minecraft:ender_pearl" /> which you get from [*Endermen*](../creatures/monster-enderman.md) or from bartering in the [*Nether*](../world/dimensions.md#nether) 
and <ItemLink id="minecraft:blaze_powder" /> which you also get in the [*Nether*](../world/dimensions.md#nether) from [*Blazes*](../creatures/monster-blaze.md).

You need around 20 of them.

    <RecipesFor id="minecraft:ender_eye" />

## Step 2: Find the structure

The next step is to find a [*Stronghold*](../world/structures.md#stronghold). 

You can find one by throwing <ItemLink id="minecraft:ender_eye" /> in the air, they will fly straight in the direction of the [*Stronghold*](../world/structures.md#stronghold). The eye has a 20% chance of shattering 
and an 
80% chance of surviving per throw.  

If they stop and burst in midair, it's underneath.

## Step 3: Make your way to the portal

Locate the *End Portal*-Room in the [*Stronghold*](../world/structures.md#stronghold) and fill in the empty <ItemLink id="minecraft:end_portal_frame" /> blocks with <ItemLink id="minecraft:ender_eye" />.

Before you go through the portal, __make sure you have everything with you__, once you go through you can't go back until you defeat the [*Ender Dragon*](../creatures/boss-ender_dragon.md) (the endboss of Minecraft) or 
die.
