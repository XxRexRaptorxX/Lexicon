# The first night.

The first night is very dangerous if you are not prepared for it. 

I recommend building you into a mountain at dusk and looking for *Ores* in the meantime. 

Use the *Coal* you find to smelt food and ores and make *Torches*. 
And *Iron Ingots* to craft higher quality *Tools* and *Armor* for you.

But don't dig too deep and watch out for *Monsters* in caves! 

*Torches* and light prevent them from spawning.
