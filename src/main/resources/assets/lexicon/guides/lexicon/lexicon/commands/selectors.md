# Selectors

Target selectors are used in commands to select [*Players*](../creatures/human-player.md) and entities arbitrarily, without needing to specify an exact name. 

One or more entities can be selected with a target selector variable, and targets can be filtered from the selection based on certain criteria using the target selector arguments.


**/gamemode creative @a ** 

**@p** = nearest player 

**@r** = random player 

**@a** = all players 

**@e** = all entities 

**@s** = entity executing the command

## Selector Arguments

After a target selector, optional arguments can be used to narrow down the set of targets to a group that also matches certain criteria. 

- **!** = inverts the argument 
- Arguments can also be stacked 

*/gamemode creative @a[!distance=5] 

*/gamemode creative @a[distance=10,level=13]

**x****, **y**, **z** = coordinate
**distance** = the distance 
**dx**, **dy**, **dz** = volume dimensions 
**scores** = specific scores 
**tag** = scoreboard tag 
**team** = scoreboard team 
**name** = entity name 
**type** = entity type 
**predicate** = entity predicate 
**x_rotation** = vertical entity rotation 
**y_rotation** = horizontal entity rotation 
**nbt** = entity nbt data 
**level** = XP level 
**gamemode** = player game mode 
**advancements** = advancements 
**limit**, **sort** = trait limit
