# Beehive

<ItemImage id="minecraft:beehive" />

Each time a [*Bee*](../creatures/arthropod-bee.md) enters a nest or hive covered in pollen, it starts converting it to *Honey* and *Honeycomb*. 

Once it's full, it changes its appearance to show honey oozing out. 

To harvest *Honey*, the [*Player*](../creatures/human-player.md) uses a *Glass Bottle* on the hive. 
To harvest *Honeycomb*, the [*Player*](../creatures/human-player.md) uses *Shears* on the nest or hive.
