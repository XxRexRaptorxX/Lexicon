# Useful aids

__There are a few things that make it easier for you to build:__ 
- When you sneak (*Shift* Key) you can't fall over block edges, useful when you build at big heights. 

- You can also use *Shift* to build blocks that would otherwise open her inventory. 

- Use *Scaffoldings* when constructing tall structures.


- Can be built and expanded quickly 

- Can be easily climbed 

- If you destroy one, all of them above collapse too
