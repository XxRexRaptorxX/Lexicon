*Creepers* chase any [*Player*](./human-player.md) within a 16 block radius. They do not voluntarily attack any other mob. When within 3 blocks of a [*Player*](./human-player.md), a *Creeper* stops moving, hisses, flashes and expands and explodes after 1.5 seconds, destroying blocks in the area as well as significantly damaging the target. It can be charged with a lightning bolt.
