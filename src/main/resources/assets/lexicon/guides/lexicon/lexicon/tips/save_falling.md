# Save Falling

__There are a variety of ways to avoid fall damage:__ 

- Some blocks can reduce fall damage: *Hay Balls*, *Slime Blocks*, *Honey Blocks*, [*Beds*](../useables/bed.md), *Cobwebs*, *Powdered Snow*, ... 

- Landing in *Water* prevents all fall damage. If you are falling from a height you should quickly empty a *Water Bucket* onto the block you'll land on so the *Water* can break your fall.

- *Boats* can completely nullify fall damage for themselves and any [*Players*](../creatures/human-player.md) & [*Mobs*](../crafting.md) inside, making them useful for travel through *Mountains* or through the 
[*Nether*](../world/dimensions.md#nether). 

- *Boots* with [*Feather Falling*](../enchanting/enchantments.md#feather_falling) Enchantment. 

- [*Potions of Slow Falling*](../brewing/brewing.md)
