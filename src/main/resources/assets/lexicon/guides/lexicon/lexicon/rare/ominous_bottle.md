# Ominous Bottle

<ItemImage id="minecraft:ominous_bottle" />

An *Ominous Bottle* is an item that gives a [*Players*](../creatures/human-player.md) the [*Bad Omen*](../brewing/effects.md#bad_omen) effect for 100 minutes when drunk. 

*Ominous Bottles* have 5 levels, which correspond with the 5 levels of the effect.



*Ominous Bottles* are dropped by *Raid Captains* outside of raids, at a random level.
