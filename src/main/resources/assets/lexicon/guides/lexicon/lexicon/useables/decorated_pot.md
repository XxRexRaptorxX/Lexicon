# Decorated Pots

<ItemImage id="minecraft:decorated_pot" />

A *Decorated Pot* is a storage block crafted from *Bricks* and/or [*Pottery Sherds*](../rare/pottery_sherds.md), with the items used individually affecting the appearance of its four side faces. 

It can store a single inventory slot's worth of items, which cannot be seen or retrieved by hand without breaking the pot.

-----

The pot's sides correspond to the item used in the crafting. 

If a [*Pottery Sherd*](../rare/pottery_sherds.md) is used, that side bears the texture of that sherd, if a *Brick* is used, that side bears the default texture.
