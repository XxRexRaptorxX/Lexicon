# Speed Boat

If [*Players*](../creatures/human-player.md) drive *Boats* on *Ice*, they will suddenly find themselves launching at speeds that they didn't think were possible. 

This is a great way to travel from one area to another extremely fast. 

While all types of *Ice* will provide this effect when combined with *Boats*, *Blue Ice* will provide the fastest travel.
