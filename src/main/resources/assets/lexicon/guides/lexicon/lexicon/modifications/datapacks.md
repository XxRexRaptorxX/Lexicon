# Data Packs

A *Data pack* provides a way for [*Players*](../creatures/human-player.md) to further customize their Minecraft experience. 

These packs can be used to override or add new advancements, dimensions, functions, loot tables, predicates, recipes, structures, tags, world generation settings, and biomes without any code modification.
