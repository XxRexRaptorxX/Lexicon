# Map Marker

Using on a *Banner* with a *Map* selected places a marker of the banner's position on the selected *Map*, and using on the *Banner* again removes the marker. 

The marker has the same color as the banner. 

The marker is removed if the banner is destroyed unless the map is locked using a [*Cartography Table*](../useables/cartography_table.md).

If the banner is renamed, the name appears below the marker.
