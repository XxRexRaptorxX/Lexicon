# Vault

<ItemImage id="minecraft:vault" />

A <ItemLink id="minecraft:vault" /> is a block found in [*Trial Chambers*](../world/structures.md#trial_chambers). 

It dispenses loot when unlocked using a [<ItemLink id="minecraft:trial_key" />](./trial_keys.md). 

Each <ItemLink id="minecraft:vault" /> can be looted by an unlimited number of [*Players*](../creatures/human-player.md), but each one can unlock a 
specific <ItemLink id="minecraft:vault" /> only once.

<ItemLink id="minecraft:vault" /> cannot be obtained in Survival and cannot be moved with a [<ItemLink id="minecraft:piston" />](../redstone/redstone_components.md#piston). 

There's also an *Ominous* <ItemLink id="minecraft:vault" />, it dispenses more valuable loot when unlocked using an [<ItemLink id="minecraft:ominous_trial_key" />](./trial_keys.md).
