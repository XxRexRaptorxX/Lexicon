# Vault

<ItemImage id="minecraft:vault" />

A *Vault* is a block found in [*Trial Chambers*](../world/structures.md#trial_chambers). 

It dispenses loot when unlocked using a [*Trial Key*](./trial_keys.md). 

Each *Vault* can be looted by an unlimited number of [*Players*](../creatures/human-player.md), but each one can unlock a specific *Vault* only once.

*Vaults* cannot be obtained in Survival and cannot be moved with a [*Piston*](../redstone/redstone_components.md#piston). 

There's also an *Ominous Vault*, it dispenses more valuable loot when unlocked using an [*Ominous Trial Key*](./trial_keys.md).
