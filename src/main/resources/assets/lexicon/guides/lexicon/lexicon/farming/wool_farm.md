# Wool Farm

This farm automatically shears the [*Sheep*](../creatures/animal-sheep.md) by testing with an [<ItemLink id="minecraft:observer" />](../redstone/redstone_components.md#observer) 
if the [*Sheep*](../creatures/animal-sheep.md)
have grown new <ItemLink id="minecraft:white_wool" /> from eating the <ItemLink id="minecraft:grass_block" />. 

It's important that there are still an additional <ItemLink id="minecraft:grass_block" /> to let the <ItemLink id="minecraft:dirt" /> grow back.
