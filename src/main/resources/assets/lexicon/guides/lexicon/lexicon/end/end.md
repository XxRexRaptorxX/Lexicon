# The End Fight

When you enter the [*End*](../world/dimensions.md#end), get to the center of the island as quickly as possible, and if you see the [*Ender Dragon*](../creatures/boss-ender_dragon.md) diving at you, quickly jump out of its way. 

Before fighting, you need to do destroy all *<ItemLink id="minecraft:end_crystal" />* above the <ItemLink id="minecraft:obsidian" /> pillars, because they heal the dragon. 

The best way to do this, with a <ItemLink id="minecraft:bow" /> or <ItemLink id="minecraft:crossbow" />.

### How to fight the dragon: 

While the dragon is flying you can shoot it. 

When it's hovering over the portal, it is immune to <ItemLink id="minecraft:arrow" /> damage, and you are forced to use your *Sword*. 

Here, get as many critical hits as possible, which deal more damage.

<GameScene zoom={1} interactive={true}>
  <Entity id="minecraft:ender_dragon" y={0} />
</GameScene>

It's useful to collect the [<ItemLink id="minecraft:dragon_breath" />](../rare/dragons_breath.md) with a <ItemLink id="minecraft:glass_bottle" /> during the fight because it can be used to make 
[*Lingering Potions*](../brewing/potion_types.md#lingering_potion).

    When you kill the [*Ender Dragon*](../creatures/boss-ender_dragon.md) you will get a lot of XP, the rare & unique [<ItemLink id="minecraft:dragon_egg" />](../rare/dragon_egg.md), 
    a portal back to the [*Overworld*](../world/dimensions.md#overworld) and a gateway portal to the outer end islands.
