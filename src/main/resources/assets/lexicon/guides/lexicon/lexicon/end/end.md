# The End Fight

When you enter the [*End*](../world/dimensions.md#end), get to the center of the island as quickly as possible, and if you see the [*Ender Dragon*](../creatures/boss-ender_dragon.md) diving at you, quickly jump out of its way. 

Before fighting, you need to do destroy all *End Crystals* above the *Obsidian* pillars, because they heal the dragon. 

The best way to do this, with a *Bow* or *Crossbow*.

**__How to fight the dragon:__** 

While the dragon is flying you can shoot it. 

When it's hovering over the portal, it is immune to *Arrow* damage, and you are forced to use your *Sword*. 

Here, get as many critical hits as possible, which deal more damage.

<GameScene zoom={6}>
  <Entity id="minecraft:ender_dragon" y={-5} />
</GameScene>

It's useful to collect the [*Dragon's Breath*](../rare/dragons_breath.md) with a *Glass Bottle* during the fight because it can be used to make [*Lingering Potions*](../brewing/potion_types.md#lingering_potion).

When you kill the [*Ender Dragon*](../creatures/boss-ender_dragon.md) you will get a lot of XP, the rare & unique [*Dragon Egg*](../rare/dragon_egg.md), a portal back to the [*Overworld*](../world/dimensions.md#overworld) and a gateway portal to the outer end islands.
