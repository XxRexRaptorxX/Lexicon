*Wardens* are completely blind and wander randomly around the world after spawning. They are immune to *Fire* and *Lava* damage, and are not affected by [*Knockback*](../enchanting/enchantments.md#knockback). 
Nearby vibrations agitate the *Warden*, and it moves toward where the sound originated. 
They can spread out [*Darkness Effects*](../brewing/effects.md#darkness) and sniff the surrounding area.
