# Plugins

A *Plugin* (or a multiplayer plug-in) is an additive file for a Minecraft multiplayer server. 

*Plugins* are often used to change certain aspects of the game, such as adding user rankings, or the addition of game modes, economy and more.


*Plugins* do not change the game code itself, as a [*Mod*](./mods.md) does.
