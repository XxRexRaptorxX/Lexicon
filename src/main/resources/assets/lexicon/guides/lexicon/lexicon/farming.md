# Farming

Farms are used to acquire various resources efficiently. 

- __Manual farms__ rely mostly or solely on the [*Player*](./creatures/human-player.md) to harvest and restart the farm. 

- __Semi-automatic farms__ use mechanisms to automatically harvest the farm, but they are manually activated by the [*Player*](./creatures/human-player.md). 

- __Fully automatic farms__ do not rely on the [*Player*](./creatures/human-player.md) at all and usually use [*Mobs*](./creatures.md) or more complicated mechanisms.
