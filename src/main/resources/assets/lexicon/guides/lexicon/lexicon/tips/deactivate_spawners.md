# Deactivate Spawners

You should never mine [*Spawners*](../rare/spawner.md), they can still be very useful for e.g. mob traps or simply farming. 

You should try deactivating them with light instead. 
Just put a *Torch* or something like that on the [*Spawners*](../rare/spawner.md). 

Only [*Blaze*](../creatures/monster-blaze.md)- & [*Silverfish*](../creatures/arthropod-silverfish.md)-[*Spawners*](../rare/spawner.md) need a lot more light in the area to disable it.
