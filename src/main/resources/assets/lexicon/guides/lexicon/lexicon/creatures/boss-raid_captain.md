# Miniboss - Raid Captain

A *Raid Captain* is the occurrence of an illager spawning with an [*Ominous Banner*](../rare/ominous_banner.md) on top of its head, usually a [*Pillager*](./human-pillager.md) or [*Vindicator*](./human-vindicator.md), or rarely an [*Evoker*](./human-evoker.md). 

*Raid Captains* usually act the same as if they were a normal illager, but other illagers follow behind them.
