# Combinations

An [*Anvil*](../useables/anvil.md) can be used to combine the enchantments of two items, sacrificing one of them and repairing the other. 

The items must be compatible, they must either be the same type and material (such as two *Iron Swords*) or an item and an *Enchanted Book* with an applicable enchantment (such as a *Bow* and an *Infinity Enchanted Book*).

Combining two enchanted items, *Books* or one of each with the same enchantment at the same level produces an item or book with the next higher level of that enchantment up to the maximum. 

To combine items, the [*Player*](../creatures/human-player.md) places the target item in the [*Anvil's*](../useables/anvil.md) first slot and the sacrifice item in the second slot.
