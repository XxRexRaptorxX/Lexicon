# Combinations

<ItemImage id="minecraft:anvil" />

An [<ItemLink id="minecraft:anvil" />](../useables/anvil.md) can be used to combine the [*Enchantments*](./enchantments.md) of two items, sacrificing one of them and repairing the other. 

The items must be compatible, they must either be the same type and material (such as two *Iron Swords*) or an item and an
<ItemLink id="minecraft:enchanted_book" /> with an applicable [*Enchantment*](./enchantments.md) (such as a <ItemLink id="minecraft:bow" /> and 
an *[Infinity](enchantments.md#infinity) <ItemLink id="minecraft:enchanted_book" />*). 

-----

Combining two enchanted items, *Books* or one of each with the same [*Enchantment*](./enchantments.md) at the same level produces an item or book with the next higher level of that [*Enchantment*](./enchantments.md) up to the maximum. 

To combine items, the [*Player*](../creatures/human-player.md) places the target item in the first slot of an [<ItemLink id="minecraft:anvil" />](../useables/anvil.md) and the sacrifice item in the second 
slot.
