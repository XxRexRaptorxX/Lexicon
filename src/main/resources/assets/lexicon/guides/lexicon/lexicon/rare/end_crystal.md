# End Crystal

<ItemImage id="minecraft:end_crystal" />

Spawn also in [*The End*](../world/dimensions.md#end), their primary purpose is to recharge the health of the [*Ender Dragon*](../creatures/boss-ender_dragon.md). 

But they are also quite powerful in PvP when used correctly, because they can only be placed on *Obsidian* or *Bedrock*.

-----

If 4 are placed on the end exit portal, one on each of the flat sides, the crystals respawn the original *End Crystals* on the *Obsidian* pillars, as well as resurrect the [*Ender Dragon*](../creatures/boss-ender_dragon.md) itself!

*End Crystals* explode when attacked or damaged in most ways and do a lot of damage.
