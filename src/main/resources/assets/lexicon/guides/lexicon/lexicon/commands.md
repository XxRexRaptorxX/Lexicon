# Commands

Commands, are advanced features activated by typing certain strings of text. 

In the client, commands are entered via [*Command Block*](./redstone/redstone_components.md#command_block) or chat window, which is displayed by pressing the **T** or **/ key**. 

Pressing **Tab** while entering commands cycles through possible commands or arguments, and can be used to auto-enter them.
