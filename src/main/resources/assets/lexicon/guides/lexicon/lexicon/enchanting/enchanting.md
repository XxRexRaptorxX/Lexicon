# Enchanting

__There are a few ways to enchant items:__ 
- Through an [<ItemLink id="minecraft:enchanting_table" />](../useables/enchanting_table.md) in exchange for experience points and <ItemLink id="minecraft:lapis_lazuli" />. 
Only unenchanted items may be enchanted this way. 
- Through an [<ItemLink id="minecraft:anvil" />](../useables/anvil.md), combining an <ItemLink id="minecraft:enchanted_book" /> with an item. 
- Through an [<ItemLink id="minecraft:anvil" />](../useables/anvil.md), combining two of the same item with different existing enchantments into a single item that has the enchantments of both. 
- Through a [*Librarian Villager*](../creatures/human-villager.md#librarian), which may enchant a <ItemLink id="minecraft:book" /> respectively for <ItemLink id="minecraft:emerald" /> 
- instead of <ItemLink id="minecraft:lapis_lazuli" /> and experience.

An item can be enchanted by using an [<ItemLink id="minecraft:enchanting_table" />](../useables/enchanting_table.md) and placing the item in the input slots and 1–3 <ItemLink id="minecraft:lapis_lazuli" /> 
in its dedicated slot. Upon placing the item, three randomized enchanting options appear on the right.

## Increasing the level

To increase the enchantment level, <ItemLink id="minecraft:bookshelf" />* can be placed next to the [<ItemLink id="minecraft:enchanting_table" />](../useables/enchanting_table.md) 
while keeping one block of air between them. 

The only choices available have a level requirement equal to or below the player's current level and a <ItemLink id="minecraft:lapis_lazuli" /> requirement equal to or below the number of lapis placed in the table.
