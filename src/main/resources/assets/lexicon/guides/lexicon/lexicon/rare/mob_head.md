# Mob Heads

<ItemImage id="minecraft:wither_skeleton_skull" />

A [*Wither Skeleton*](../creatures/undead-wither_skeleton.md) has a 2.5% chance of dropping a *Wither Skeleton Skull* when killed by a [*Player*](../creatures/human-player.md). 

The chance is increased by 1% per level of [*Looting*](../enchanting/enchantments.md#looting).

<ItemImage id="minecraft:creeper_head" />

[*Skeleton*](../creatures/undead-skeleton.md), [*Wither Skeleton*](../creatures/undead-wither_skeleton.md), [*Zombie*](../creatures/undead-zombie.md), [*Piglins*](../creatures/monster-piglin.md) and [*Creeper*](../creatures/monster-creeper.md) *-Heads* are also always dropped by the respective mob if it dies due to a [*Charged Creeper's*](../creatures/monster-creeper.md) explosion. 

Wearing the corresponding mob head reduces the detection range to 50% of the normal range.

<ItemImage id="minecraft:dragon_head" />

*Dragon Heads* generate on [*End Ships*](../world/structures.md#end_ship) found in [*End Cities*](../world/structures.md#end_city).

<ItemImage id="minecraft:player_head" />

*Player Heads* have an extra usage for map makers, they can be given [*NBT Data*](../commands/nbt-data.md) so that they appear with the skin of any Minecraft account. But they cannot be reached in survival by default. 

To get this heads, use this [*Command*](../commands.md): __/give @p minecraft:player_head{SkullOwner:*ACCOUNT_NAME*____}__
