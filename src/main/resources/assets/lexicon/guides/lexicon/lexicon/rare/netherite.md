## Netherite

<ItemImage id="minecraft:netherite_scrap" />

*Netherite* is a rare material from the [*Nether*](../world/dimensions.md#nether), used primarily to upgrade *Diamond* gear. 

*Netherite* items are more powerful and durable than *Diamond*, can float in lava, and cannot burn. 

- For *Netherite*, you must first find *Ancient Debris* in the [*Nether*](../world/dimensions/nether.md)!
