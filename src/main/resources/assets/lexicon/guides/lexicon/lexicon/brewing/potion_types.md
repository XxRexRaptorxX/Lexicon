# Potion Types

__There are 3 different potion types:__ 

- Potion 

- Splash Potion 

- Lingering Potion

<a name="potion"></a>
## Potion

<ItemImage id="minecraft:potion" />

*Potions* can be used by pressing and holding use, similarly to eating food. 
Upon using, they apply the corresponding status effect to the [*Player*](../creatures/human-player.md). 

<a name="splash_potion"></a>
## Splash Potion

<ItemImage id="minecraft:splash_potion" />

*Splash Potions* are thrown by using them. 

On impact they explode, applying status effects to nearby entities.

<a name="lingering_potion"></a>
## Lingering Potion

<ItemImage id="minecraft:lingering_potion" />

*Lingering Potions* are thrown, like *Splash Potions*, by using them. 

On impact they explode, creating a cloud. 

The cloud is made of the potion particles corresponding to the potion that was thrown.
