# Shulker Box

<ItemImage id="minecraft:shulker_box" />

*Shulker Boxes* are portable [*Chests*](../useables/chest.md): they keep their items when broken, which can be retrieved when placed again. 

This is different from other containers, which drop their contained items as item entities when broken. 

These boxes are made out of *Shulker Shells* that are dropped by [*Shulkers*](../creatures/monster-shulker.md) in [*The End*](../world/dimensions.md#end).

##  


*Shulker Boxes* are dyeable!
