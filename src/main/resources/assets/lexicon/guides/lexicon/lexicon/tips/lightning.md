# Lightning Effects

Lightning is spawned during a thunderstorm with higher chances on a *Lightning Rod* or when a *Trident* enchanted with [*Channeling*](../enchanting/enchantments.md#channeling) is thrown. 

__Lightning bolts can have many different effects:__ 
- Hurt entities and set them on fire

- Creates fires on impact 

- Spawns with a 0.75-6.75% chance a *Skeleton Trap Horse* which transforms into 4 *Skeletal Horsemen* when triggered

__A lightning strike affects certain mobs differently:__ 

- A *[Pig](../creatures/animal-pig.md)* turns into a [*Zombified Piglin*](../creatures/undead-zombified_piglin.md) 

- A [*Creeper*](../creatures/monster-creeper.md) becomes a [*Charged Creeper*](../creatures/monster-creeper.md) 

- A [*Villager*](../creatures/human-villager.md) turns into a [*Witch*](../creatures/human-witch.md) 

- A Red [*Mooshroom*](../creatures/animal-mooshroom.md) turns into a Brown [*Mooshroom*](../creatures/animal-mooshroom.md) 

- A Brown [*Mooshroom*](../creatures/animal-mooshroom.md) turns into a Red [*Mooshroom*](../creatures/animal-mooshroom.md)
