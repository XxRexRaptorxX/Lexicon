# Stonecutter

<ItemImage id="minecraft:stonecutter" />

The *Stonecutter* is used to craft *Stone* and *Copper* related blocks in smaller and more precise quantities than crafting, and is more efficient than crafting for certain recipes. 

It also serves as a [*Stone Mason's*](../creatures/human-villager.md#mason) job site block.
