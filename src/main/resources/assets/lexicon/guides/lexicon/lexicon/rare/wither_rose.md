# Wither Rose

<ItemImage id="minecraft:wither_rose" />

A *Wither Rose* is a unique flower with negative properties. 

Any [*Player*](../creatures/human-player.md) or mob that touches it will be granted the [*Wither effect*](../brewing/effects.md#wither). 

They can only be obtained when the [*Wither*](../creatures/boss-wither.md) kills another mob.
