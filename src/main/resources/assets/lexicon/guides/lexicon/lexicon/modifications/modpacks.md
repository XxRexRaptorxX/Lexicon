# Mod Packs

*Mod packs* are collections of [*Mods*](./mods.md) that have been put together and configured so that they all work together. 

These packs are often centered around a general theme like tech, quests, or magic.

*Mod packs* often have either custom launchers or installers that make installing and running the pack easy.
