# Monster Spawner

<ItemImage id="minecraft:spawner" />

A *Monster Spawner* activates when a [*Player*](../creatures/human-player.md) comes within a spherical radius of 16 blocks from the center point of the block and constantly spawns instances of that mob as long as a [*Player*](../creatures/human-player.md) is nearby and, if applicable for the mob it spawns, if there are valid dark areas nearby.

It cannot be obtained as an item in survival mode or moved by a [*Piston*](../redstone/redstone_components.md#piston), and it drops only experience orbs when broken. 

The *Spawner* can be configured to spawn a desired mob by using a *Spawn Egg* on the placed block.
