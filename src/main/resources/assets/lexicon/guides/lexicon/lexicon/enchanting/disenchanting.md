# Disenchanting

<ItemImage id="minecraft:grindstone" />

The only way to disenchant items is via the [*Grindstone*](../useables/grindstone.md) or by repairing the items via the crafting grid. 

-----

Using the [*Grindstone*](../useables/grindstone.md) removes all [*Enchantments*](./enchantments.md) (except [*Curses*](./curses.md)) and gives experience back based on the level of the enchantment(s) and their value.
