# Disenchanting

<ItemImage id="minecraft:grindstone" />

The only way to disenchant items is via the [*Grindstone*](../useables/grindstone.md) or by repairing the items via the crafting grid. 

Using the [*Grindstone*](../useables/grindstone.md) removes all enchantments (except curses) and gives experience back based on the level of the enchantment(s) and their value.
