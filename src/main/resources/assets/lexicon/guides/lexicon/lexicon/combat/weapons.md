# Weapons

There are many different *Weapons* and *Tools* in the game that you can use to fight. 

There are a few things to consider: 

- Attack Damage 
- Attack Speed 
- Attack Cooldown 
- Critical Hits 
- Possible Enchantments

-----

## Damage & Speed

DPS = Damage per second

-----

## Attack Cooldown

When the [*Player*](../creatures/human-player.md) attacks too quickly, it reduces the strength of the attacks. 

The base damage done (as a fraction of the full possible damage) depends on the time between attacks, which is also reflected in the height of the held *Weapon* on screen and the attack indicator bar

-----

## Critical Hits

A critical hit is an attack that deals extra damage compared to a regular attack. Critical melee strikes, regardless of the weapon used, cause small star particles to fly out of the target who was critically hit. 
An <ItemLink id="minecraft:arrow" /> shot from a fully charged <ItemLink id="minecraft:bow" /> have a *25%* chance of becoming critical. 

In melee combat, a critical hit occurs when a [*Player*](../creatures/human-player.md) attacks a mob while falling, including while coming down from a jump, but not while jumping up. 
The attack deals *150%* of the attack's base damage.
