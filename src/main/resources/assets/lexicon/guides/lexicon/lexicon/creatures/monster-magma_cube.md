*Magma Cubes* cannot be hurt by fall damage or burning. They can swim upward in *Lava* and leap above its surface. Their jump height depends on their size. Their forward speed is twice that of most other mobs. When a *Magma Cube* is killed, it splits into 2-4 smaller once. Tiny *Magma Cubes* disappear when killed, like other mobs.
