# Dimensions

Dimensions are accessible realms within a world characterized by a way of generation, biomes and structures, and other things unique to one dimension. 

[*Players*](../creatures/human-player.md) can explore and discover various dimensions in Minecraft, typically through the use of portals. 

The daylight cycle and weather may work differently or not exist in different dimensions, as well as respawn points (such as [*Beds*](../useables/bed.md) and [*Respawn Anchors*](../useables/respawn_anchor.md)) and travel speed. 

Other dimensions can be access with portals.
