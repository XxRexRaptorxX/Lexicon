# Dragon Egg

<ItemImage id="minecraft:dragon_egg" />

The <ItemLink id="minecraft:dragon_egg" /> is a trophy item, and is the __rarest__ item obtainable in the game, as it generates only __once__ per world. 

It's generated on top of the exit portal when the first [*Ender Dragon*](../creatures/boss-ender_dragon.md) is defeated.

The egg usually cannot be mined directly, as trying to do so causes it to teleport. 

-----

The <ItemLink id="minecraft:dragon_egg" /> is a gravity-affected block, and drops as an item when pushed by a [<ItemLink id="minecraft:piston" />](../redstone/redstone_components.md#piston) 
or when it falls onto a block less than a full block tall, such as a <ItemLink id="minecraft:torch" /> or a *Bottom Slab*. 

When destroyed by an explosion, the block always drops as an item.
