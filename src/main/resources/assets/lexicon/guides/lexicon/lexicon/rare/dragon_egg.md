# Dragon Egg

<ItemImage id="minecraft:dragon_egg" />

The *Dragon Egg* is a trophy item, and is the __rarest__ item obtainable in the game, as it generates only once per world. 

It's generated on top of the exit portal when the first [*Ender Dragon*](../creatures/boss-ender_dragon.md) is defeated.

The egg usually cannot be mined directly, as trying to do so causes it to teleport. 

The *Dragon Egg* is a gravity-affected block, and drops as an item when pushed by a [*Piston*](../redstone/redstone_components.md#piston) or when it falls onto a block less than a full block tall, such as a *Torch* or a *Bottom Slab*. 

When destroyed by an explosion, the block always drops as an item.
