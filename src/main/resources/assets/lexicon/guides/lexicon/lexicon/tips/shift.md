# The important Shift Key

__The Shift Key has many useful functions that you should know:__ 
- When crafting, *Shift* + *clicking* the crafting output automatically crafts the maximum number of that item for the materials being used and moves all crafted items to the inventory. 
- Holding *Shift* + *Right click* on an usable block with a block in hand overrides the *USE* action and places the block instead. 
- When you hold *Shift* you can't fall over block edges.


- When the inventory is open, *Shift* + *clicking* on an item or stack moves it between the inventory and the hotbar. 
- *Shift* + *clicking* on a piece of armor, a mob head or a pair of *Elytra* moves it between the inventory and the armor slot. 
- *Shift* + *clicking* on a *Shield* moves it between the inventory and the off-hand slot. 
- When a container is open, *Shift* + *clicking* on an item moves up to a stack between the container and the inventory. 
- *Shift* + *double clicking* moves all items of the same kind. To *Shift* + *double click*, get one item in hand, and while holding *Shift*, *double click* on another item type to move it.
