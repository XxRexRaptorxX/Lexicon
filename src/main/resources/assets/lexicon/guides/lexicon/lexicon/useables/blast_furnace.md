# Blast Furnace

<ItemImage id="minecraft:blast_furnace" />

A *Blast Furnace* is a block that smelts ores, raw metals, metal armor and tools, similar to a [*Furnace*](./furnace.md), but at twice the speed and fewer output. 

It also serves as an [*Armorer's*](../creatures/human-villager.md#armorer) job site block.
