# Jukebox

<ItemImage id="minecraft:jukebox" />

A [*Jukebox*](./jukebox.md) playing music from a [*Music Disc*](../rare/music_discs.md) emits a level 15 signal, powering any adjacent [*Redstone Wires*](../redstone/redstone_components.md#redstone), [*Repeaters*](../redstone/redstone_components.md#repeater), and mechanism components. 

The signal turns off when the music track ends or if the disc is removed before the track ends. 
If the [*Player*](../creatures/human-player.md) places a [*Comparator*](../redstone/redstone_components.md#comparator) besides a *Jukebox*,

##  

the intensity of the redstone signal depends on the disc currently inserted. 

The [*Comparator*](../redstone/redstone_components.md#comparator) is powered as long as a disc is stored inside the *Jukebox*, even if it has stopped playing.
