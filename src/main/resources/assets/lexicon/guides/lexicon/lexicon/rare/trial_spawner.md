# Trial Spawner

<ItemImage id="minecraft:trial_spawner" />

A <ItemLink id="minecraft:trial_spawner" /> is a type of [<ItemLink id="minecraft:spawner" />](./spawner.md) found only within [*Trial Chambers*](../world/structures.md#trial_chambers). 

It spawns mobs in waves, which increase in number the more [*Players*](../creatures/human-player.md) are nearby. 

When all of its spawned mobs are defeated, it ejects a combination of consumable items and/or [<ItemLink id="minecraft:trial_key" />](./trial_keys.md), then goes inactive for 30 minutes.

It cannot be obtained as an item or moved by a [<ItemLink id="minecraft:piston" />](../redstone/redstone_components.md#piston). 

-----

A <ItemLink id="minecraft:trial_spawner" /> converts into an *Ominous* <ItemLink id="minecraft:trial_spawner" /> during an *Ominous Trial* which is triggered when a 
[*Players*](../creatures/human-player.md) with [*Bad Omen*](../brewing/effects.md#bad_omen) comes near the spawners. 

The *Ominous* <ItemLink id="minecraft:trial_spawner" /> releases more difficult [mobs](../creatures.md) and ejects more powerful loot.
