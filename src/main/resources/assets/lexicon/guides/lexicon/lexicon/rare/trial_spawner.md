# Trial Spawner

<ItemImage id="minecraft:trial_spawner" />

A *Trial Spawner* is a type of [*Spawner*](./spawner.md) found only within [*Trial Chambers*](../world/structures.md#trial_chambers). 

It spawns mobs in waves, which increase in number the more [*Players*](../creatures/human-player.md) are nearby. 

When all of its spawned mobs are defeated, it ejects a combination of consumable items and/or [*Trial Keys*](./trial_keys.md), then goes inactive for 30 minutes.



It cannot be obtained as an item or moved by a [*Piston*](../redstone/redstone_components.md#piston). 

A *Trial Spawner* converts into an *Ominous Trial Spawner* during an *Ominous Trial* which is triggered when a [*Players*](../creatures/human-player.md) with [*Bad Omen*](../brewing/effects.md#bad_omen) comes near the spawners. 

The *Ominous Trial Spawner* releases more difficult mobs and ejects more powerful loot.
