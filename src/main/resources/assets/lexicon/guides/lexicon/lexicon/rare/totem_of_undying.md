# Totem of Undying

<ItemImage id="minecraft:totem_of_undying" />

If a [*Player*](../creatures/human-player.md) is holding a *Totem of Undying* in their off-hand or main-hand slot and receives otherwise fatal damage, the totem saves them from death. 

It is dropped from [*Evokers*](../creatures/human-evoker.md), which spawn in [*Woodland Mansions*](../world/structures.md#mansion) and raids.

When activated, the totem restores 1 life, removes all existing status effects and grants you: 

- [*Regeneration II*](../brewing/effects.md#regeneration) for 45s 
- [*Fire Resistance*](../brewing/effects.md#fire_resistance) for 40s 
- [*Absorption II*](../brewing/effects.md#absorption) for 5s
