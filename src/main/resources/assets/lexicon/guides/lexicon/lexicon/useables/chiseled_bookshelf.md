A redstone [*Comparator*](../redstone/redstone_components.md#comparator) sends a signal (1â€“6) indicating the last slot interacted with. 

When no slot has been interacted with yet, it outputs 0. 

An [*Observer*](../redstone/redstone_components.md#observer) can detect when a *Book* is added or removed from the bookshelf.

The correspondences between slot and signal power.
