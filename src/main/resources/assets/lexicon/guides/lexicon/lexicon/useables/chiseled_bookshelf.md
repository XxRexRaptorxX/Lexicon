# Chiseled Bookshelf

<ItemImage id="minecraft:chiseled_bookshelf" />

*Chiseled Bookshelves* can hold up to six *Books*, *Books and Quills*, *Written Books*, *Enchanted Books*, and/or other types of books.

<Recipe id="minecraft:chiseled_bookshelf" />

A redstone [*Comparator*](../redstone/redstone_components.md#comparator) sends a signal (1–6) indicating the last slot interacted with. 

When no slot has been interacted with yet, it outputs 0. 

-----

An [*Observer*](../redstone/redstone_components.md#observer) can detect when a *Book* is added or removed from the bookshelf.

The correspondences between slot and signal power.
