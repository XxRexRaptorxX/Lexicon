# General

Crafting is the process of constructing tools, items, and blocks. 

[*Players*](../creatures/human-player.md) can craft by moving items from their inventory to a crafting grid, arranging them according to a recipe. 

A 2×2 crafting grid can be accessed from the inventory and a 3×3 grid can be accessed by using a [*Crafting Table*](../useables/crafting_table.md).


Items crafted in the 2×2 grid can also be crafted in the 3x3 grid.

The *Recipe Book* is a mechanic that serves as a catalog of recipes and as a crafting guide. 

It shows every crafting recipe that the [*Players*](../creatures/human-player.md) has had materials for.
