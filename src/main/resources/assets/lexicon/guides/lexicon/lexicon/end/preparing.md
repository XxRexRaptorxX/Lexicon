# Preparing

Getting to the [*End*](../world/dimensions.md#end) in Minecraft is no simple feat. 

Unlike getting to the [*Nether*](../world/dimensions.md#nether), you can't build a portal wherever you want and hop to the [*End*](../world/dimensions.md#end) on the way back from the grocery store. 
There's a whole process involved, and a pinch of luck, if you want a chance to face the [*Ender Dragon*](../creatures/boss-ender_dragon.md). 

If you do it, you also get access to a whole new dimension filled with new stuff!

-----

If you're thinking of making the trip, you need to prepare: 

- A full set of *Diamond* or *[Netherite](../rare/netherite.md) Armor* 
- The weapon of your choice 
- A *Bow* or *Crossbow* 
- *Eyes of Ender* i suggest around 20 
- *Ender Pearls* or a *Water Bucket* to avoid fall damage 
- Healing items like [*Potions*](../brewing/potion_types.md) 
- Enough *Arrows*, *Food*, *Wood*, building blocks like *Cobblestone* and repair material
