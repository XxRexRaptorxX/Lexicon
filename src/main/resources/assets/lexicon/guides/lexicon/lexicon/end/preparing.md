# Preparing

Getting to the [*End*](../world/dimensions.md#end) in Minecraft is no simple feat. 

Unlike getting to the [*Nether*](../world/dimensions.md#nether), you can't build a portal wherever you want and hop to the [*End*](../world/dimensions.md#end) on the way back from the grocery store. 
There's a whole process involved, and a pinch of luck, if you want a chance to face the [*Ender Dragon*](../creatures/boss-ender_dragon.md). 

If you do it, you also get access to a whole new [dimension](../world/dimensions.md) filled with new stuff!

#### If you're thinking of making the trip, you need to prepare: 

- A full set of <ItemLink id="minecraft:diamond" />- or better *[Netherite](../rare/netherite.md) Armor* 
- The [weapon](../combat/weapons.md) of your choice 
- A <ItemLink id="minecraft:bow" /> or <ItemLink id="minecraft:crossbow" /> 
- A few <ItemLink id="minecraft:ender_eye" />, i suggest around 20 
- A few <ItemLink id="minecraft:ender_pearl" /> or a <ItemLink id="minecraft:water_bucket" /> to avoid fall damage 
- Healing items like [*Potions*](../brewing/potion_types.md) 
- Enough *Arrows*, *Food*, *Wood*, building blocks like <ItemLink id="minecraft:cobblestone" /> and repair material
