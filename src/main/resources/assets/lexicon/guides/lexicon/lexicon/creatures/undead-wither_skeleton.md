*Wither Skeletons* are immune to fire and the [*Wither effect*](../brewing/effects.md#wither). They still seek shade or water during daylight if they are in the [*Overworld*](../world/dimensions.md#overworld) although they do not burn in sunlight. Like most undead mobs, they sink in *Water* but do not drown, are healed by [*Instant Damage*](../brewing/effects.md#instant_damage) and harmed by [*Instant Health*](../brewing/effects.md#instant_health) effects, are immune to [*Regeneration*](../brewing/effects.md#regeneration) and [*Poison effects*](../brewing/effects.md#poison).
