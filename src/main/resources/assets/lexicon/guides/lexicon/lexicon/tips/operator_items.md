# Operator Items

In the operator utilities you will find functional items and blocks that are primarily intended for server owners, creators, mapmakers or experienced users. 

They are only accessible via the **/give** [*Command*](../commands.md) or in the creative inventory by activating it at __*options/controls/operator item tab*__.
