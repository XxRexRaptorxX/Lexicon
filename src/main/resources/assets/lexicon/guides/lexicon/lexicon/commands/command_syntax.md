# Command Syntax

The syntax shows you which arguments are possible for the individual keywords of the commands. 

You can see the syntax in the **/help** command or on sites like the [Minecraft Wiki](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Commands).

----

**plain text** = command text

**\<argument\>** = argument that should be replaced with the value

**\<entry\>** = optional entry 

**(entry|entry)** = Pick one of the required entries 

**[entry|entry]** = Pick one of the optional entries 

**ellipsis ...** = another sub-command required
