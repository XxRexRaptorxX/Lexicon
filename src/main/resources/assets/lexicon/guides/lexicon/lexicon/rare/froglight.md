# Froglight

A *Froglight* is a luminous natural block that can be obtained if a [*Frog*](../creatures/aquatic_animal-frog.md) eats a tiny [*Magma Cube*](../creatures/monster-magma_cube.md). 

It is used for decoration. They emit light level 15, the highest level possible for a light-emitting block.

-----

There are three colors of *Froglight* that drop depending on the type of frog:

<ItemImage id="minecraft:verdant_froglight" /> __Verdant__ from cold (green) frogs 

<ItemImage id="minecraft:ochre_froglight" /> __Ochre__ from temperate (orange) frogs
