# Froglight

<ItemImage id="minecraft:pearlescent_froglight" />

A *Froglight* is a luminous natural block that can be obtained if a [*Frog*](../creatures/aquatic_animal-frog.md) eats a tiny [*Magma Cube*](../creatures/monster-magma_cube.md). 

It is used for decoration.

There are three colors of *Froglight* that drop depending the type of frog: 

- __Pearlescent__ from warm (white) frogs 

- __Verdant__ from cold (green) frogs 

- __Ochre__ from temperate (orange) frogs

<ItemImage id="minecraft:verdant_froglight" />

They emit light level 15, the highest level possible for a light-emitting block.
