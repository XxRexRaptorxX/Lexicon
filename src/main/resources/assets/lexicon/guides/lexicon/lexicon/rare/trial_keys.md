# Trial Keys

<ItemImage id="minecraft:trial_key" />

A *Trial Key* is an item that can be obtained from a [*Trial Spawner*](./trial_spawner.md) and used to unlock standard [*Vaults*](./vault.md). 

Using a key on vaults unlocks it, causing it to eject items and the key to be consumed.

It can be obtained from an [*Ominous Trial Spawner*](./trial_spawner.md).
