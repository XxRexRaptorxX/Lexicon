# Classic Food Farms

__Requirements for most plant-based Farms__: 
- Transform *Dirt* with a *Hoe* to *Farmland.* 

- *Farmland* needs a *Water* source up to 4 blocks away. 

- Light is required. 

- Many farms require their chunks to be ticked that the state of growth changes. That means a [*Player*](../creatures/human-player.md) must be nearby (within 128 blocks), or you use a *Chunk Loader* from a [*Mod*](../modifications/mods.md).

The first farm you should always be a simple, classic *Wheat* or *Vegetable* farm.
