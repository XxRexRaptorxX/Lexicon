Can be equipped with a *Saddle* and they can be ridden in water up to 3 blocks deep with up to two [*Players*](./human-player.md). *Camels* are tall enough that most melee hostile cannot reach the players to attack them. They have the ability of 'dashing'. When dashing, the *Camel* launches up to 12 blocks forward and one block upward.
