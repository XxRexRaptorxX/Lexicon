# Beacon

<ItemImage id="minecraft:beacon" />

A *Beacon* is a block that projects a light beam skyward and can provide status effects such as [*Speed*](../brewing/effects.md#speed), [*Jump Boost*](../brewing/effects.md#jump_boost), [*Haste*](../brewing/effects.md#haste), [*Regeneration*](../brewing/effects.md#regeneration), [*Resistance*](../brewing/effects.md#resistance), or [*Strength*](../brewing/effects.md#strength) to nearby [*Players*](../creatures/human-player.md) when activated with a pyramid.

##  



<Recipe id="minecraft:beacon" />

There are four possible pyramid heights. More levels make more powers available. 
Can be built with *Iron/Gold/Emerald/Diamond/Netherite* blocks.
