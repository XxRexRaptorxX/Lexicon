# Sniffer Egg

<ItemImage id="minecraft:sniffer_egg" />

A <ItemLink id="minecraft:sniffer_egg" /> is a block that can be brushed out of [<ItemLink id="minecraft:suspicious_sand" />](./suspicious_sand.md)
in [*Warm Ocean Ruins*](../world/structures.md#ruin), or obtained by breeding two [*Sniffers*](../creatures/animal-sniffer.md). 

It slowly hatches into a [*Snifflet*](../creatures/animal-sniffer.md) when placed as a block in the world, which takes half as much time when it is 
placed on a <ItemLink id="minecraft:moss_block" />.
