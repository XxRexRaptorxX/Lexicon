# Sniffer Egg

<ItemImage id="minecraft:sniffer_egg" />

A *Sniffer Egg* is a block that can be brushed out of [*Suspicious Sand*](./suspicious_sand.md) in [*Warm Ocean Ruins*](../world/structures.md#ruin), or obtained by breeding two [*Sniffers*](../creatures/animal-sniffer.md). 

It slowly hatches into a [*Snifflet*](../creatures/animal-sniffer.md) when placed as a block in the world, which takes half as much time when it is placed on a *Moss block*.
