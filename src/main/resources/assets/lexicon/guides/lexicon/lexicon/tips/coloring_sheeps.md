# Coloring Sheeps

[*Sheeps*](../creatures/animal-sheep.md) wool can be dyed by pressing the use key or the interact button while holding any dye. 

If a [*Sheep*](../creatures/animal-sheep.md) is dyed and then sheared, it retains its new dyed *Wool* color after the it regrows.

__Easter Egg:__ 

If a [*Sheep*](../creatures/animal-sheep.md) is named *jeb_* with a *Name Tag*, its *Wool* cycles with interpolation through all dye colors. 

This does not affect the dropped *Wool*.
