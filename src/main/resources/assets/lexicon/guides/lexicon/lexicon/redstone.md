# Redstone

Redstone is the *Minecraft* equivalent of electricity. 

Knowing the basics of redstone allows you to create amazing inventions. 

You can obtain [*Redstone Dust*](./redstone_components.md#redstone) by mining *Redstone Ore* underground. 

You can spread this dust across the ground as wire, attach it to [*Levers*](./redstone_components.md#lever) or [*Doors*](./redstone_components.md#door), and craft it into [*Torches*](./redstone_components.md#torch) and [*Repeaters*](./redstone_components.md#repeater) to build huge machines.
